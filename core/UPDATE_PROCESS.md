# Framework Update Process

**How to propagate Claude Brain Framework updates to your projects**

## üîÑ Update Philosophy

When the framework evolves, your projects should benefit from improvements while preserving your customizations.

## üìä Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
- **Major (2.0.0):** Breaking changes - requires migration
- **Minor (1.5.0):** New features - safe auto-update
- **Patch (1.5.1):** Bug fixes - always safe

### Checking for Updates

**User asks Claude:**
```
"Check for claude-brain-framework updates"
```

**Claude automatically:**
1. Reads `CHANGELOG.md` from framework repo
2. Compares with project's current version
3. Explains what changed
4. Offers to update if beneficial

## üéØ Update Detection

### CLAUDE: How to Check for Updates

When user requests update check:

```bash
# 1. Check framework repo CHANGELOG
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcosmenm/claude-brain-framework/main/CHANGELOG.md

# 2. Compare versions
# Project version in: [PROJECT]/CLAUDE.md (last line)
# Latest version in: CHANGELOG.md (top entry)

# 3. Present findings
"Framework Update Available:
 - Current: v1.0.0
 - Latest: v1.5.0
 - Type: Minor (safe to update)
 
 Changes:
 - [Feature 1]
 - [Feature 2]
 
 Would you like me to update your project?"
```

## üìã Update Workflow

### Step 1: Detection (Automatic or On-Request)

**Automatic (session start - from VERSION_DETECTION.md):**
```
User: [Opens project and starts working]

Claude: [AUTOMATIC CHECK]
"I notice this project is on framework v1.0.0, but v1.2.0 is available.

You're missing 2 updates:

**v1.1.0** (2025-10-13):
- Multi-Repository System Template
- Documentation Index Template
- Incremental Documentation Strategy

**v1.2.0** (2025-10-20):
- Lean Development Workflow methodology
- CI/CD Deployment Guide
- Enhanced behavioral rules

Would you like me to:
1. Apply all updates (v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.2.0) - Recommended
2. Apply only v1.1.0
3. Apply only v1.2.0
4. Skip for now

Your choice?"
```

**On-request:**
```
User: "Check for updates"

Claude: "Checking claude-brain-framework...

        Update Available: v1.5.0 (Minor)
        Current: v1.0.0

        New Features:
        - Enhanced agent patterns
        - MCP auto-detection
        - Chat summary improvements

        Safe to update automatically. Proceed?"
```

### Step 2: Handle User Choice

**If user chooses "Apply all" (recommended):**
```
Claude: "Applying v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.1.0 ‚Üí v1.2.0...

        Reading CHANGELOG for migration steps...
        [Proceeds with full update]"
```

**If user chooses specific version (e.g., "Only v1.1.0"):**
```
Claude: "Applying only v1.1.0 updates...

        Note: You'll remain on v1.1.0. I'll notify you about v1.2.0
        in future sessions until applied.

        [Proceeds with v1.1.0 update only]"
```

**If user chooses "Skip for now":**
```
Claude: "Understood. Proceeding with your work.

        I'll remind you about available updates next session.
        [Proceeds with user's original request]"
```

**Critical Rule:** Track which updates were offered and skipped to avoid repetitive notifications.

---

### Step 3: Review
```
Claude: "Here's what will change in your project:
        
        Updated Files:
        - core/AGENT_PATTERNS.md (new agents added)
        - templates/CLAUDE_MD_UNIVERSAL.md (MCP section)
        
        New Files:
        - templates/MCP_INTEGRATION.md
        
        Your Customizations:
        ‚úì Preserved in CLAUDE.md
        ‚úì Preserved in Documentation/
        ‚úì PRPs unchanged
        
        Proceed with update?"
```

### Step 4: Application
```
Claude: "Updating your project...
        
        ‚úì Backed up current files
        ‚úì Downloaded v1.5.0 templates
        ‚úì Applied updates
        ‚úì Preserved customizations
        ‚úì Updated version to 1.5.0
        
        Update complete! Review changes:
        - New agent patterns available
        - MCP detection in init process
        - Chat summaries enhanced
        
        Want me to show you how to use new features?"
```

## üîí Customization Preservation

### What Gets Preserved
**Always kept:**
- Your CLAUDE.md customizations
- Your Documentation/ content
- Your PRPs (active and completed)
- Your .claude/agents/ configurations
- Project-specific patterns

**Updated (carefully):**
- Core methodology (if not customized)
- Templates (merge improvements)
- Agent catalog (add new, keep custom)

### How Preservation Works
```
1. Identify customized sections
   - Compare with framework defaults
   - Mark custom content

2. Apply updates smartly
   - Framework sections: Update
   - Custom sections: Preserve
   - Merged sections: Integrate carefully

3. Validate integration
   - Ensure no conflicts
   - Test critical paths
   - Verify patterns still work
```

## üö® Breaking Change Migration

   ```
